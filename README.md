# 2D RPG Unity Game Learning Project

Welcome to my learning project repository, based on the Udemy course ["Learn How to Create a 2D RPG Game with Unity"](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-create-a-2d-rpg-game-with-unity/) by Gianny Dantas. This project is part of my journey to mastering game development with Unity, focusing on 2D RPG games. Through this course, I aim to understand the core principles of game design, development, and scripting in Unity.
